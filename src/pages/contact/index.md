### The Developers of GPlates

GPlates is developed by an international team of scientists and professional software developers at:

* the [Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences](http://www.gps.caltech.edu/) (GPS) at CalTech (under the direction of Michael Gurnis)

The Geodynamics Team at the [Geological Survey of Norway](https://www.ngu.no/en) (NGU) have contributed to GPlates in the past.
