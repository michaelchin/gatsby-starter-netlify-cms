### What is AuScope?

!["AuScope Logo"](./img/AuScope-logo.png "AuScope Logo")

GPlates development by the [EarthByte](https://www.earthbyte.org/) Project is part of the [AuScope](https://www.auscope.org.au/) infrastructure-development programme. AuScope Ltd is a non-profit company formed to facilitate the implementation of a world-class infrastructure system for earth science, funded by the Australian Government under the [National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy](https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris) (NCRIS).

The EarthByte Project participates in one of the components of the AuScope programme:

* AuScope [Simulation, Analysis & Modelling (SAM)](https://www.auscope.org.au/sam)

As part of this participation, GPlates developers at the EarthByte Project collaborate with other AuScope project, including:

* [Underworld](https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld2)

### GPlates in Simulation, Analysis & Modelling (SAM)

The goal of the [Simulation, Analysis & Modelling (SAM)](https://www.auscope.org.au/sam) component is to build a toolkit of simulation, modelling, inversion and data mining tools.

The EarthByte Project participates in the AuScope Modelling & Simulation component to develop GPlates to provide kinematic surface-constraints for geodynamic simulation software such as the widely-used, open-source, spherical mantle-convection package CitComS and the next-generation AuScope-funded mantle-convection package [Underworld](https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld2).
